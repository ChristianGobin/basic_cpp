This is just a log of my progress while learning C++. From basic data types to pointers and more.

        A bus can can transport 50 passengers at once. Given the number of passengers waiting in the bus station as input, you need to calculate and output how many empty seats the last bus will have.
        <p> ex: input = 126 -> 126 (total) - 50(bus 1) = 76 (left at station) - 50 (bus 2) = 26 (left at station) The rest fit on bus 3. Answer = 26. </p>
