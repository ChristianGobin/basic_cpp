            You are making a program for a bus service. A bus can transport 50 passengers at once. Given the number of passengers waiting in the bus station as
            input, you need to calculate and output how many empty seats the last bus will have.

    <dd>Given 2 strings, string a and b:
        <ul>
            <li> In the first line print two space-separated integers, representing the length of a and b respectively. </li>
            <li> In the second line print the string produced by concatenating a and b. </li>
            <li> In the third line print two strings separated by a space, a2 and b2 , and  are the same as a and b, respectively, 
            except that their first characters are swapped.</li>

        Write a program that asks the user to enter the following: an integer representing the number of cents. The Program should then display how to provide that change to the user. My denominations are in USD where:
            <ul>
                <li> 100 cents = 1 dollar </li>
                <li> 25 cents = 1 quarter </li>
                <li> 10 cents = 1 dime </li>
                <li> 5 cents = 1 nickel </li>

        You will be given 2 positive integers: a, b. Where (a <= b) separated by a new line.<br/>
        For each integer n between [a,b] inclusive interval:
        <ul>
            <li> if n >= 1 and n <= 9: print the english representation of the number. (ex. 8 -> "eight") </li>
            <li> else if n > 9 and even: print even. </li>

    <dt>While Loop Exercise</dt>
    <dd>
    Given a vector of integers, determine how many integers are present before you see the value -99. Note, it's possible -99 is not in the vector! If -99 is not in the vector then the result will be equal to the number of elements in the vector. The final result should be stored in an integer named count.

    <dd>
        Create a Console Application that takes an integer list, and allows users to enter a character to perform an action on the list.

            Actions able to execute and their function:
            <ul>
                <li>Add: ('A','a') -> Prompt user for integer to append to list.</li>
                <li>Print: ('P','p') -> Print list to the console.</li>
                <li>Mean: ('M','m') -> Display mean of list Values.</li>
                <li>Smallest: ('S','s') -> Display smallest integer in list.</li>
                <li>Largest: ('L','l') -> Display largest integer in list.</li>
                <li>Quit: ('Q','q') -> Quit menu. </li>
