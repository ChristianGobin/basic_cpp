<p> 
This is just a log of my progress while learning C++. From basic data types to pointers and more.

        <p>
            You are making a program for a bus service. A bus can transport 50 passengers at once. Given the number of passengers waiting in the bus station as
            input, you need to calculate and output how many empty seats the last bus will have.

    <dd>Given 2 strings, string a and b:
        <ul>
            <li> In the first line print two space-separated integers, representing the length of a and b respectively. </li>
            <li> In the second line print the string produced by concatenating a and b. </li>
            <li> In the third line print two strings separated by a space, a2 and b2 , and  are the same as a and b, respectively, 
            except that their first characters are swapped.</li>
        </ul>

    <dd>
        <p>
        Write a program that asks the user to enter the following: an integer representing the number of cents. The Program should then display how to provide that change to the user. My denominations are in USD where:
            <ul>
                <li> 100 cents = 1 dollar </li>
                <li> 25 cents = 1 quarter </li>
                <li> 10 cents = 1 dime </li>
                <li> 5 cents = 1 nickel </li>
            </ul>
