            You are making a program for a bus service. A bus can transport 50 passengers at once. Given the number of passengers waiting in the bus station as
            input, you need to calculate and output how many empty seats the last bus will have.

    <dd>Given 2 strings, string a and b:
        <ul>
            <li> In the first line print two space-separated integers, representing the length of a and b respectively. </li>
            <li> In the second line print the string produced by concatenating a and b. </li>
            <li> In the third line print two strings separated by a space, a2 and b2 , and  are the same as a and b, respectively,

        Write a program that asks the user to enter the following: an integer representing the number of cents. The Program should then display how to provide that change to the user. My denominations are in USD where:
            <ul>
                <li> 100 cents = 1 dollar </li>
                <li> 25 cents = 1 quarter </li>
                <li> 10 cents = 1 dime </li>

    <dd>
    Given a vector of integers, determine how many integers are present before you see the value -99. Note, it's possible -99 is not in the vector! If -99 is not in the vector then the result will be equal to the number of elements in the vector. The final result should be stored in an integer named count.

        Users can manipulate values of a Vector Int Array using a console menu. The menu takes the input of the user and performs the corresponding operation on the vector. Upper and Lower cases for each choice are supported. These include :
        <ul>
            <li> "P" - Print All Values in array </li>
            <li> "A" - Add Int to array </li>
            <li> "M" - Print Mean of array </li>
            <li> "S" - Print Smallest int of array </li>
